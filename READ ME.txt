Hello, this is Nic.

You've forked this source code from smilz0's github: https://github.com/smilz0/Dot4GPT

Karon, imong gi modify ang source code and you make a version, where supported ang various LLM providers and also local like ollama.

With the help of aistudio google gemini 2.5 Pro, you manage to make this modification.

Mao pud ni ang steam community niya:

https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/3023020742/3805032265618990484/

But since modified code naman ni, this is how it works:

You just run the Dot4GPT.exe(CMD Terminal ni siya) inside sa Release folder.

For the first time, it will create a settings.json for you.

Then e configure na lang nimo ang settings.json.

Close the Dot4GPT.exe and reopen again, and you're done!

Expiremental pa ni siya, so don't expect nga ang software walay bug. But working man siya 95%.
